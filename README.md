# WiFi Brute Force Script

This Python script helps you test the security of a Wi-Fi network by attempting to connect using a list of potential passwords. It’s a simple tool for educational purposes, so use it responsibly!

## What You’ll Need

- **Python 3.x**: Make sure you have Python installed. If you don’t, grab it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).
- **`pywifi` library**: This library is essential for interacting with Wi-Fi networks in Python.

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Install Python
If you don’t already have Python installed, download and install it from the official website: [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

### Step 2: Install the `pywifi` Library
Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command to install the `pywifi` library:
```bash
pip install pywifi
Step 3: Download the Script
You can either clone this repository or download the script (wifi.py) and the password list (password.txt) directly to your computer.

Running the Script
Open a Terminal:
Navigate to the folder where you saved the script (wifi.py) and the password list (password.txt).

Start the Script:
Run the script using the following command:

bash
Copy
python wifi.py
Enter the Details:

When asked, type in the SSID (name) of the Wi-Fi network you’re testing.

Provide the path to your password list file (e.g., password.txt).

Wait for the Results:
The script will try each password in the list one by one. If it finds the correct password, it’ll let you know!

What You’ll See
Here’s an example of what the output might look like:

bash
Copy
$ python wifi.py
Enter the SSID of the target Wi-Fi network: MyWiFi
Enter the path to the password list file: password.txt
SSID: MyWiFi, trying password 1: password123
SSID: MyWiFi, trying password 2: 12345678
SSID: MyWiFi, trying password 3: qwerty
Password found successfully: qwerty
Breaking It Down:
SSID: MyWiFi, trying password 1: password123:
The script is testing the first password (password123) from your list.

Password found successfully: qwerty:
If the script connects to the network, it’ll show you the correct password (in this case, qwerty).

Example Password List
Your password.txt file should look something like this:

Copy
password123
12345678
qwerty
admin
letmein
welcome
Important Note
This script is for educational purposes only. Always make sure you have permission to test the Wi-Fi network you’re targeting. Unauthorized access to networks is illegal and unethical. Use this tool responsibly!
