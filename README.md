# WiFi Brute Force Script

This script is designed to brute-force a Wi-Fi network's password using a list of potential passwords.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `pywifi` library

## Installation

1. **Install Python**:  
   Make sure you have Python 3.x installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

2. **Install the `pywifi` library**:  
   Run the following command to install the required library:
   ```bash
   pip install pywifi
   
## Download the script:
- Clone this repository or download the script (wifi.py) and the password list (password.txt) to your local machine.

## How to Run the Tool
Open a terminal or command prompt:
Navigate to the folder where you downloaded the script (wifi.py) and the password list (password.txt).

## Run the script:
### Use the following command to start the tool:

bash
Copy
python wifi.py
## Enter the required information:

When prompted, enter the SSID (name) of the target Wi-Fi network.

Provide the path to the password list file (e.g., password.txt).

Wait for the results:
The script will attempt to connect to the Wi-Fi network using each password in the list. If the correct password is found, it will be displayed.

Expected Output
When you run the script, you will see output similar to the following:

bash
Copy
$ python wifi.py
Enter the SSID of the target Wi-Fi network: MyWiFi
Enter the path to the password list file: password.txt
SSID: MyWiFi, trying password 1: password123
SSID: MyWiFi, trying password 2: 12345678
SSID: MyWiFi, trying password 3: qwerty
Password found successfully: qwerty
Explanation of the Output:
SSID: MyWiFi, trying password 1: password123:
This means the script is trying the first password (password123) from the list.

Password found successfully: qwerty:
This means the script successfully connected to the Wi-Fi network using the password qwerty.

Example Password List (password.txt)
Here is an example of what your password.txt file might look like:

Copy
password123
12345678
qwerty
admin
letmein
welcome
